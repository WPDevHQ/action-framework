== Description ==

Hi. I'm a starter theme development framework - use me to create something beautiful. Just add some CSS/JS love and hook you markup in the appropriate places to get going.
For an example theme built action-framework see https://github.com/WPDevHQ/actions

Please do bare in mind that I'm not your conventional starter theme and you'd be well advised to study me and my derivative in order to understand how to customize me.
